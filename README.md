# Problem Statement:

Build a job portal where people can view/ post contract jobs.

There are two sections to this portal: Freelancer & Employer.

## Freelancer Section:

    User Profile:
        • Users should be able to select skills matching their profile, add their GitHub profile, and list their projects. Basic form validations are required.

    Job Listing Page:
            • Users should be able to see all posted jobs, filter by skill set or minimum salary per hour, and quickly apply to jobs with a single click.

## Employer section:

    Post Jobs:
        • Employers should be able to post new jobs with detailed descriptions, requirements, relevant tags, and company information.

    View Application:
            • Employers should be able to view the number of applications for their posted jobs and see the user profiles of the job applicants.

## Stretch goals

1. Responsive design.
2. Dark mode theming
